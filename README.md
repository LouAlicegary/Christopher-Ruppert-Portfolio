Christopher Ruppert Artist Portfolio
====================================

Local Portland artist Christopher Ruppert asked me to redesign his website and put together a mobile version for him. Because the database structure containing the details of his piece was already in place, I ended up working around that and hand-coding a site instead of going with an off-the-shelf CMS, I decided to hand code the site. Information about Christopherâ€™s work is hosted in a SQL database, and the interface is written in PHP and Javascript/JQuery.
